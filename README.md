## 🧠 1. Project Overview

Telecom companies lose **millions of dollars every year due to customer churn**. Understanding *who is likely to leave* and **why** is crucial for customer retention. This project builds a **multimodal AI system** to address this challenge by combining structured and unstructured data analysis.

- **Structured Data Analysis:** Utilizes traditional Machine Learning (ML) models (e.g., XGBoost) on customer demographics, service usage, and billing information to predict the likelihood of churn.
- **Unstructured Data Analysis:** Employs Deep Learning (DL) models (e.g., CNN + BiLSTM + Attention) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of customer feedback text.
- **Multimodal Fusion:** The system is designed to integrate the outputs of both models to provide a more robust and explainable prediction of customer behavior.
- **Business Intelligence dashboards:**  Power BI
- **Explainability & Insights:**  SHAP + dashboards
  
The final outcome is a  **production-ready CRM intelligence system** that supports **data-driven retention strategies**.

---

## ❗ 2. Problem Statement

- Customers leave telecom services due to **billing confusion**, **poor support**, or **network issues**.
- Business teams **lack AI-driven tools** to analyze customer feedback + behavior together.
- Manual CRM analysis is **slow**, **biased**, and **reactive**, instead of **proactive**.

> **The core question addressed by this project is:** Can an AI system effectively detect early churn indicators AND provide a clear explanation of *why* customers are leaving by synthesizing insights from both structured service data and unstructured feedback text?

This project demonstrates that a **combined ML + DL system** can successfully achieve this goal.
